# Custom Reinforcement Learning Environment

**Author:** Odelola Solomon Oluwatobiloba  


## Introduction
This project involves the creation of a custom reinforcement learning environment leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Gym, and NumPy. The environment is designed to provide a unique and challenging platform for training reinforcement learning agents. 

## Features
- Custom reinforcement learning environment compatible with OpenAI's Gym.
- Modular and extensible code structure using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
- Efficient numerical computations with NumPy.
- Interactive frontend interface with HTML and Bootstrap.

## Installation
To set up the environment, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
